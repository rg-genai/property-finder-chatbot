# AI Property Assistant (Mumbai) - Test Project

Welcome to the AI Property Assistant, a chatbot designed to help you explore potential properties for sale in Mumbai based on your preferences.

## What This Chatbot Does

This chatbot aims to assist you in finding properties by asking you a series of questions about your desired location, budget, preferred size, and other criteria. Based on your input, it will search for relevant property listings and provide you with a summary and recommendations.

## How to Use

Simply type your preferences into the chat interface. The chatbot will guide you through the process of providing the necessary information. Once it has enough details, it will attempt to find and present you with potential property matches.

## Important Limitations

Please be aware that this is a **test project** and has several limitations:

* **No Real-time Web Scraping for Accuracy:** This chatbot does not perform live, real-time web scraping of property portals to get the most up-to-the-minute and accurate results. The information it uses is based on searches using general search engines and the analysis capabilities of an AI model. Therefore, the property details, availability, and pricing might not be entirely accurate or current.
* **Not a Substitute for Professional Advice:** The recommendations provided by this chatbot are for informational purposes only and should not be considered as professional real estate advice. Always consult with qualified real estate agents and conduct thorough due diligence before making any property decisions.
* **Limited Search Scope:** The search capabilities are currently limited and might not cover all available properties in Mumbai.
* **AI Model Capabilities:** The accuracy and relevance of the analysis and recommendations depend on the capabilities of the underlying AI model (Gemini). It might sometimes provide incomplete or less accurate information.
* **Test Project Nature:** This project is intended for demonstration and testing purposes. It might not be continuously maintained or updated.

## Technologies Used

* Streamlit (for the user interface)
* Google Gemini API (for property analysis and summarization)
* DuckDuckGo Search (for initial property listing searches)
